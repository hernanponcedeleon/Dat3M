PTX
(* NVIDIA. Parallel Thread Execution ISA Version 7.5 *)

// Base relations:
// vloc: virtual address mapping to the same generic address
// sr: same-scope
// scta: same-cta
// sync_barrier: synchronize by barriers with same logical barrier resource (barID)
// sync_fence: synchronize by morally strong fence.sc

// Scope Tags:
// CTA: Cooperative thread array, is an array of threads that execute a kernel concurrently or in parallel.
//      The CTA scope is the set of all threads executing in the same CTA as the current thread.
// GPU: Graphics processing unit. The GPU scope is the set of all threads executing in the same cluster as the current thread.
// SYS: System. The SYS scope is the set of all threads in the current program.

// Proxy Tags:
// GEN: Generic memory space, this is the memory space that proxy-less PTX memory model(ptx-v6.0) applies to.
// SUR: Surface memory, used by graphics workloads
// TEX: Texture memory, used by graphics workloads
// CON: Constant memory, is a small, distinct address space reserved to hold fixed values.

// Comparing to the ptx-v7.5 model written in Alloy (https://github.com/NVlabs/mixedproxy)
// The ptx-v7.5 alloy model uses this Causality-axiom "irreflexive ((rf | co | fr)?; cause)".
// The ptx-v6.0 alloy model uses "irreflexive ((rf | fr)?; cause)".
// The ASPLOS'19 paper and the documentation refer to "rf | fr" (non-optional). 
// We follow the later.
