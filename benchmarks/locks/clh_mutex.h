/*
 * This is a C11 implementation of the CLH lock where the previous node is removed.
 * See slide 45 here:
 * http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/comp422/lecture-notes/comp422-lec19-s08-v1.pdf
 *
 * Notice that this lock is NOT recursive, but it is easy to make it recursive.
 *
 * This mutual exclusion lock is "Starvation-Free", assuming that the run-time
 * can provide that kind of guarantee.
 *
 * It is possible to remove the field "mynode" from clh_mutex_node_t, but
 * then we need to use either a thread-local variables to store them, or we
 * need to return it from clh_mutex_lock() and pass it to
 * clh_mutex_unlock() as argument, which is ok for some usages, but hard to
 * do for others.
 * In C++1x, it should be easy to use this technique with a "Guard" pattern
 * and then pass the operation on the object associated with the mutex through
 * a lambda.
 * The advantage of this last approach is that there are no loads, stores, or
 * false-sharing for "mynode"  because the compiler can put those variables on
 * a register, or at worse, on the current thread's stack.
 *
 * This locking mechanism has some similarities with the MCS lock because each
 * thread is spinning on the "islocked" of the previous node, which means that
 * each thread is waiting on a different cache-line, thus reducing
 * synchronization.
 * http://www.cise.ufl.edu/tr/DOC/REP-1992-71.pdf
 * The main different from the MCS lock (section 2) is that MCS may have to do
 * an Compare-And-Swap in addition to the atomic_store() in the unlock function.
 *
 * The CLH lock uses the (theoretically) minimum amount of synchronization
 * operations to perform a mutual exclusion lock, because:
 * - In the lock() function it has a single synchronized operation
 *   atomic_exchange() with one acquire and one release barrier.
 * - In the unlock() function is has a single synchronized operation, the
 *   atomic_store() with a release barrier.
