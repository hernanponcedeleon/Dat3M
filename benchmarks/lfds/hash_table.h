/*
 * A simple lock-free hash table as described in
 * https://preshing.com/20130605/the-worlds-simplest-lock-free-hash-table/
 
 * Think of each thread as having its own private copy of the shared array. 
 * Modifications to the shared array will eventually propagate to each 
 * thread’s private copy, but not necessarily in the same order that they 
 * were written. Therefore, when get() examines each array entry, its 
 * private copy of that entry may contain any of the following combinations:
 
 * 1. (0, 0)        The end of the item list. The key passed to get() was not found.
 * 2. (key, 0)      An item that has not yet been fully initialized by a parallel call 
 *                  to set(). If the key matches the one passed to get(), 0 is returned, 
 *                  which is fine.
 * 3. (key, value)  A fully initialized, valid item in the collection.
 * 4. (0, value)    Only possible if the stores performed by a single set() call got 
 *                  reordered either by the compiler or the processor, and have not yet fully 
 *                  propagated to this thread’s private copy. get() will treat this as the 
 *                  end of the item list, which means the key passed to get() was not found, 
 *                  which is fine.
