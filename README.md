</p>

**Dartagnan** is a tool to check state reachability under weak memory models.

Requirements
======
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (if you want to build the tools. If not see the [release](https://github.com/hernanponcedeleon/Dat3M/releases) section)
* [Java 8](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/) or above (if you want to compile from source)
* [Smack 2.5.0](https://github.com/smackers/smack) or above (only to verify C programs)
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) the concrete version depends on your `smack` version

Installation
======

**Docker**

The docker contains everything pre-installed to run the tool.

1. Build the container:
```
docker build . -t dartagnan
```

2. Run the container:
```
docker run -w /home/Dat3M -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw -it dartagnan /bin/bash
```

**From Sources**

Set Dat3M's home and add it to the path
```
export DAT3M_HOME=<Dat3M's root>
export PATH=$DAT3M_HOME/:$PATH
```

If you are verifying C code, be sure both `clang` and `smack` are in your `PATH`.

To build the tool run
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**Unit Tests**

We provide a set of unit tests that can be run by
```
mvn test
```
**Note:** there are almost 40K tests, running them can take several hs.

Usage
======
Dartagnan comes with a user interface (not available from the docker container) where it is easy to import, export and modify both the program and the memory model and select the options for the verification engine (see below).
You can start the user interface by running
```
java -jar ui/target/ui-2.0.7.jar
```
<p align="center">

</p>

Dartagnan supports programs written in the `.c`, `.litmus` or `.bpl` (Boogie code generated by smack) formats.

You can also run Dartagnan from the console:

```
java -jar dartagnan/target/dartagnan-2.0.7.jar -cat <CAT file> [-t <target>] -i <program file> [options]
```
The `-cat` option specifies the path to the CAT file.

For programs written in `.c` and `.bpl`, `<target>` specifies the architectures to which the program will be compiled. It must be one of the following: 
- none
- tso
- power
- arm
- arm8

Program written in `.litmus` format do not require such option.

Other optional arguments include:
- `-a, --alias {none, andersen, cfs}`: specifies the alias-analysis used. Option andersen (the default one) uses a control-flow-insensitive method. Option cfs uses a control-flow-sensitive method. Option none performs no alias analysis.
- `-unroll`: unrolling bound for the BMC.
- `-solver`: specifies which SMT solver to use as a backend. Since we use [JavaSMT](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt), several SMT solvers are supported depending on the OS and the used SMT logic.

Dartagnan supports input non-determinism, assumptions and assertions using the [SVCOMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2020/index.php) commands `__VERIFIER_nondet_X`, `__VERIFIER_assume` and `__VERIFIER_assert`.

**SV-COMP Experiments**

The docker container includes the [benchexec](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec) framework to run all [SV-COMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/) experiments, just run (this can take a couple of hs)
```
benchexec dartagnan.xml --no-container
```
The `dartagnan.xml` file instructs benchexec to use 4 CPUs, so either be sure your docker configuration has access to 4 CPUs or change the entry `cpuCores="4"` to match you CPUs limit.
