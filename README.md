# Dat3M: Memory Model Aware Verification

**Dartagnan** is a tool to check state reachability under weak memory models.

Requirements
======
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/) 8 or above
* [Smack](https://github.com/smackers/smack) 2.5.0 or above (only to verify C programs)
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) the concrete version depends on Smack (only to verify C programs)

Installation
======

**Docker**

The docker contains everything pre-installed to run the tool.

1. Build the container:
```
docker build . -t dartagnan
```

2. Run the container:
```
docker run -w /home/Dat3M -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw -it dartagnan /bin/bash
```

**From Sources**

Set Dat3M's home and add it to the path
```
export DAT3M_HOME=<Dat3M's root>
export PATH=$DAT3M_HOME/:$PATH
```

At least the following compiler flag needs to be set, further can be added  
```
export CFLAGS="-I$DAT3M_HOME/include"
```

If you are verifying C code, be sure both `clang` and `smack` are in your `PATH`.

To build the tool run
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**Unit Tests**

We provide a set of unit tests that can be run by
```
mvn test
```

Usage
======
Dartagnan comes with a user interface (not available from the docker container) where it is easy to import, export and modify both the program and the memory model and select the options for the verification engine (see below).
You can start the user interface by running
```
java -jar ui/target/ui-3.0.0.jar
```
<p align="center"> 
<img src="ui/src/main/resources/ui.jpg">
</p>

Dartagnan supports programs written in the `.c`, `.litmus` or `.bpl` (Boogie code generated by smack) formats.

There are three possible results for the verification:
- `FAIL`: one assertion was violated.
- `PASS`: loops have been fully unrolled and all assertions are satisfied.
- `UNKNOWN`: no assertion violation was found, but loops have not been fully unrolled (you need to increase the unrolling bound).

You can also run Dartagnan from the console:

```
java -jar dartagnan/target/dartagnan-3.0.0.jar -cat <CAT file> [-t <target>] -i <program file> [options]
```
The `-cat` option specifies the path to the CAT file.

For programs written in `.c` and `.bpl`, `<target>` specifies the architectures to which the program will be compiled. It must be one of the following: 
- none
- tso
- power
- arm
- arm8

Program written in `.litmus` format do not require such option.

Other optional arguments include:
- `-a, --alias`: specifies the alias-analysis used. Option `andersen` (the default one) uses a control-flow-insensitive method. Option `cfs` uses a control-flow-sensitive method. Option `none` performs no alias analysis.
- `-unroll`: unrolling bound for the BMC (default is 1).
- `-solver`: specifies which SMT solver to use as a backend. Since we use [JavaSMT](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt), several SMT solvers are supported depending on the OS and the used SMT logic (default is Z3).
- `-method`: specifies which solving method to use. Option `caat` (the default one) uses a customized solver for memory consistency. Options `incremental` and `assume` solve a monolithic formula using incremental/assume-based SMT solving. 

Dartagnan supports input non-determinism, assumptions and assertions using the [SVCOMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2020/index.php) commands `__VERIFIER_nondet_X`, `__VERIFIER_assume` and `__VERIFIER_assert`.

**SV-COMP Experiments**

The docker container includes the [benchexec](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec) framework to run all [SV-COMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/) experiments, just run (this can take a couple of hs)
```
benchexec dartagnan.xml --no-container
```
The `dartagnan.xml` file instructs benchexec to use 4 CPUs, so either be sure your docker configuration has access to 4 CPUs or change the entry `cpuCores="4"` to match you CPUs limit.
