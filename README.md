# Dat3M: Memory Model Aware Verification

**Dartagnan** is a tool to check state reachability under weak memory models.

Requirements
======
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/) 8 or above
* [Smack](https://github.com/smackers/smack) 2.8.0 or above (only to verify C programs)
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) the concrete version depends on Smack (only to verify C programs)
* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) (only if option `--witness.graphviz=true` is used)

Installation
======

**Docker**

The docker contains everything pre-installed to run the tool.

1. Build the container:
```
docker build . -t dartagnan
```

2. Run the container:
```
docker run -w /home/Dat3M -it dartagnan /bin/bash
```

**From Sources**

Set Dat3M's home and the folder to generate output files (the output folder can be something different)
```
export DAT3M_HOME=<Dat3M's root>
export DAT3M_OUTPUT=$DAT3M_HOME/output
```

At least the following compiler flag needs to be set, further can be added  
```
export CFLAGS="-I$DAT3M_HOME/include"
export SMACK_FLAGS="-q -t --no-memory-splitting"
```

If you are verifying C code, be sure both `clang` and `smack` are in your `PATH`.

To build the tool run
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Usage
======
Dartagnan comes with a user interface (not available from the docker container) where it is easy to import, export and modify both the program and the memory model and select the options for the verification engine (see below).
You can start the user interface by running
```
java -jar ui/target/ui-3.1.0.jar
```
<p align="center">

</p>

Dartagnan supports programs written in the `.c`, `.litmus` or `.bpl` (Boogie code generated by smack) formats.

There are three possible results for the verification:
- `FAIL`: the property was violated.
- `PASS`: loops have been fully unrolled and the property satisfied.
- `UNKNOWN`: no violation was found, but loops have not been fully unrolled (you need to increase the unrolling bound).

You can also run Dartagnan from the console:

```
java -jar dartagnan/target/dartagnan-3.1.0.jar <CAT file> [--target=<arch>] <program file> [options]
```
For programs written in `.c` and `.bpl`, value `<arch>` specifies the programming language or architectures to which the program will be compiled. It must be one of the following: 
- c11
- lkmm
- imm
- tso
- power
- arm8
- riscv

Program written in `.litmus` format do not require such option. The target architecture is supposed to match (this is responsibility of the user) the intended weak memory model specified by the CAT file. 

Further options can be specified using `--<option>=<value>`. Common options include:
- `bound`: unrolling bound for the BMC (default is 1).
- `solver`: specifies which SMT solver to use as a backend. Since we use [JavaSMT](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt), several SMT solvers are supported depending on the OS and the used SMT logic (default is Z3).
- `method`: specifies which solving method to use. Option `caat` (the default one) uses a customized solver for memory consistency. Options `incremental` and `assume` solve a monolithic formula using incremental/assume-based SMT solving. 

Dartagnan supports input non-determinism using the [SVCOMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2020/index.php) command `__VERIFIER_nondet_X`.
