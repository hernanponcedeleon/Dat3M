//TODO(TH): RelCrit, RelRMW and RelFencerel are NOT strongly static like the other static relations
// It might be reasonable to group them into weakly static relations (or alternatively the other one's into
// strongly static)
// Explanation of these ideas:
// A relation is static IFF its edges are completely determined by the set of executed events
// (irrespective of rf, co, po and any values/addresses of the events)
// We call it "strongly static", if an edge (e1, e2) exists IFF both e1 and e2 are executed
// We call it "weakly static", if the existence of edge (e1, e2) depends on other possibly other events
// E.g. RelFenceRel is weakly static since (e1, e2) exists IFF there exists a fence e3 between e1 and e2.
// (It is a composition of the strongly static relations (po & _ x F) and po)
