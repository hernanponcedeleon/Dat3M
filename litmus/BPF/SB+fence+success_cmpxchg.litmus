BPF SB+fence+success_cmpxchg

(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * This litmus test demonstrates that a successful cmpxchg operation
 * provides full ordering
 *
 * Atomic ops with a return are fully ordered and can be used in place of a
 * full barrier. This test uses such an atomic op in P0 to act as a barrier
 * but P1 uses a cmpxchg that is successful, therefore it also acts as a
 * full barrier.
