(*
 * Result: Sometimes
 *
 * A failing cmpxchg can still head a control dependency, and a second
 * failing cmpxchg can act as a read, which a control dependency will
 * not order.  Successful cmpxchg operations provide full ordering.
 *
 * Note that replacing the "r0 = 42" with "r0 += 42" causes this to
 * be forbidden due to the resulting data dependency.
 *
 * As of May 23, 2024, the BPF memory model agrees.
