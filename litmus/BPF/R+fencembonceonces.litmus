(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * This is the fully ordered (via atomic_op with fetch that acts as a full
 * barrier) version of one of the classic counterintuitive litmus tests
 * that illustrates the effects of store propagation delays.  Note that
 * weakening either of the barriers would cause the resulting test to be
 * allowed.
