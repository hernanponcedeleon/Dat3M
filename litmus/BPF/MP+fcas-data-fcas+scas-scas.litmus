(*
 * Result: Sometimes
 *
 * A failing cmpxchg can still head a data dependency, and although
 * a second failing cmpxchg can act as a read, real hardware would be
 * unable to determine that it was going to fail until it did the read,
 * which means that a failing cmpxchg must be ordered by data dependencies
 * leading to it.  Unless that hardware can do speculation, in which case,
 * as documented in the "Arm Architecture Reference Manual, for A-profile
 * architecture", document number "ARM DDI 0487J.a", data dependencies
 * do not order later failing cmpxchg operations.  See Section B.2.3.2
 * ("Intrinsic Dependency relations") page B2-173 "Compare-and-Swap
 * instructions".
 *
 * As of May 23, 2024, the BPF memory model agrees.
