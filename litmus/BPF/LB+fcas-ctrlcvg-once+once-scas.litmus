(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * A failing cmpxchg can still head a control dependency, and a trailing
 * successful cmpxchg provides full ordering.  Unlike language-level
 * models such as LKMM, this control dependency survives past any later
 * convergence of control flow.  Which is the way it should be.
 *
 * This serves as a caution when automatically converting LKMM litmus
 * tests to BPF litmus tests.  It is normally a bad thing when the
 * resulting BPF litmus test is forbidden and the original LKMM litmus test
 * is allowed.  Litmus tests such as this one, which depend on control
 * dependencies surviving control-flow convergence, are expected to be
 * forbidden in BPF and allowed in LKMM.
 *
 * As of May 23, 2024, the BPF memory model agrees.
