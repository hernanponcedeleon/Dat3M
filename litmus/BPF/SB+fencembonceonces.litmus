(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * This litmus test demonstrates that full memory barriers suffice to
 * order the store-buffering pattern, where each process writes to the
 * variable that the preceding process reads.  (Locking and RCU can also
 * suffice, but not much else.)
 *
 * atomic ops with a return are fully ordered and can be used in place of a
 * full barrier.
